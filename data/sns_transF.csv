"I don't know what I can have, I can have a baby ~ I can't have a baby these days ~ I know that I have a big baby and I know that the child is breaking every two hours, and when I go to elementary school, I thought it was pouring out, and when I was puberty, I knew itIt was more comfortable and I was comfortable with the second child, so I wanted to have more."
"Really, the childcare of the time that the generation sees.Everyone thinks that life is going and staying for a while and leading to the next generation.Think of me only one and put it off with an immature thought?I hope you are ashamed of yourself looking for excuses and reasons"
I agree that my child is worried about my child.
"It's hard for parenting.It is good to sympathize with each other that it is difficult and difficult, but it seems that parenting only talks like hell."
@solo6a If you follow the parenting news and information.
"It is hard to raise children before the stone, but as time goes by, the child's appearance is regrettable.Do you miss the pretty look a month ago ??"
"Thanks to this, the fertility rate will be lowered today."
ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I see my daughter wearing clothes in my dad.
There are three ...
"If you are 20 years old, you have to be independent."
I don't think my favor?I didn't want to know
"When I have a child, I can't ignore my peer group influence even if I grow it right."
"This is not a gag ....... If it's a house you are raising, this is this video ??????Would you have seen it like this?"
"@Jinhee_0621 In the meantime, I studied hard and graduated from Seoul National University"
"@gam_jh_ This is not a gag….Real steamed .. Besides, it's over if you are married!?Or not .. The fear of parenting is waiting.????????You have to look at the cubs of the cub…."
@flowerMoss.ht ㄱㅋㅋㅋ The dad has to deliver it later.
"I tried to end with my first son, but even the second princess came to 4 years old.In fact, I'm greedy until the third, but I see the other two.My husband should try a lot of thoughts for the third time."
The person who hasn't raised it must have been made. There's nothing pretty and happy
There's a reason why it's hard?
"There are more beautiful appearance.Growing me up, training, strengthening, or so I can live today.I have life for all reasons"
"Even if part of the cause of low birth rate is economic power, the reality is this.The state continues to flutter, but we do not believe in the nation and give birth to children, and where people believe in the country and give birth to a baby, the groom and me are believing and giving birth."
This is a no -gag steamed daily life ????
"Um .. Everyone is negative, but you don't have to raise it like this."
"It's hard to agree, but it's pretty"
"@Jinmo_Ok Oh, Dad Dad to tie me pretty ~! ~! ~ !!!"
@YOU_JS95 Look at this hahahaha
"This seems to be an extreme example ㅎㅎ All children are not like that.Of course, parents have to educate well.If you have a child, you will see different view of the world ~ And of course, it is hard to raise a child, but it is a conflict and remaining joy!happiness!I can't express it in this word."
@goldsilverlong Azaa
"It's a little bit of this content ... It's hard to encourage birth.Even if you don't have a kid, it's hard to live.There's a lot of time to laugh and feel happy, so let's stop trying to increase the number of views with this content."

"In the morning, I hit my first butt in the morning .. I'm in guilty all day long. I came to my house and cried. I was crying at night.I thought it would lose, but when I sent it, I was bruised and the time passed.Recognition.."
Mom needs to be prepared when you want to do something.??
"Mother -like mother.Even if you send it, it's going to come back soon."
Much more ㅠ _______________________
I'm still 7 years old.I can't afford to miss the beautiful days?All mothers are fighting!
"Double -earned ... If you really come home, you're going to work again."
So I really chose it alone.It was sad.This is also what I want to do.
"I want to see more beautiful appearance of my child, so I'm together, but I miss it."
"Most of the parents who take care of the children in the dual -family family, as well as the modern mother or mother, are extremely rare if the grandfather see ..."
Not a butterfly…It's really sad to be a moth .. I can't fly .. It's like a dream later.
Mom also prepared to do what you want to do ????It's really right !!
I don't want to be helpless. I am also frustrated.There are many household chores once .. I don't want to touch .. I'm burdened.It is helpless.
"My child's aunt came out of the news from the news, but no matter how much I pay for the childcare, I don't have 100 million.It's hard because it's hard to say that humans are selfish because they are selfish."
@fun__lee flew much ??
@choijoori_v comments are more impressive ㅋㅋ Full -time or working mom lol
I cry .. It's too much like my story .. But it's too difficult to change it.
"The life of thinking about what I want to do was luxurious ... because I can't do it anyway ??I shouted quickly, but when I wake up, I'm sorry and sorry for being big.Even if I get sick, I want to be sick instead, and my life prioritizes only a child.But the child is all the mother and soon the universe!The day I left my friend because my friend was better than my mom and dad, and I would like to use my life new."
It's soaked ??Most mothers can relate to ...
"Women agree with this, but ordinary men can't feel anything like this."
"I am a 7 -year -old three -year -old daughter.Even though the bridegroom helped parenting, I was so bad that I was so bad because I was in parallel with my childcare, household chores, and work."
"If you can't help with childcare, I hope you don't interfere with it.I don't want to take the hospital if I come and go, but if it gets a little better, I want to buy an ice cream or not."
@hongprogym Ah Sulfeng
@welcome_june reminds me of Yoo Jung and it's too much for me
"I want to be more faithful to the outside work, and I want to be faithful to the outside work."

"There is a good way to prevent the increase in social costs and to solve low birth rates.It is a new national duty, 'mandatory childbirth system'.At this point, most of the problems that will be in the future close to most social problems in Korea are the main causes of long -term low birth rate.The only way to solve the problems that are already progressing, such as reducing troop resources and aging, are compulsory births.Men are the only effective policies for low birth rates that carry out military duties to protect their country, and women perform their duties and maintain their country.From 19 years old to 29 -year -old Korean women, giving birth to a physical examination at the age of 19.It should be classified as a birth person so that it can respond to the current severe national disaster level of low birthrate.Of course, you should not be forced to conceive.Whether you are married to someone you want between 19 and 29 years of age, you should guarantee minimal options, whether you are in vitro pregnancy.In addition, if you unfairly reject or avoid the duty of sacred childbirth to maintain the state, you should be punished, such as the same punishment and social disadvantage as avoiding military service."

I woke up at Nedan to go to work and work from six o'clock. How do you care about my child ???
Do you see the news because it's a minimum idea that human beings say that?
It shows that the environment and multiple complex factors are the worst conditions to raise.
Please reduce the working hours of men and women to raise with parents' hands ..
You have to benefit before you have a baby.

"After five years of marriage, I wanted to have one more baby, but I wanted to have one more person, but it was so hard to find a daycare center because of my reinstatement, and my husband was promoted when he was greens, and it was difficult to go to pediatric when he was sick.You don't need 5 million won."
It's too sympathetic.
"In Japan, if there is a colleague who wrote a sixth holiday, the department members have a bonus."
"I wonder if I would like to be a little late for the benefits that improve even a little bit a year.Unfortunately?I am glad that I pray, but that's so much that it's getting better.Of course, it's very significant.Most mothers want dinner with their children and husbands!Not a school for dinner!"
I think it's more effective to attack people who have been born than those who have not been born?
"The world is a world that needs to be working together, and the mother lives in a system that has a baby and originally difficult to return to work.I hope that there are things that can be returned to work even if they have a baby, not for money."

"@Unaep_k Every time I see this, I also dink ..."
Yes ... I'll give you money if you give birth!ruler!It's good?It's too hard to raise it.
The answer to the birth rate is to create an environment so that parents can raise their children. Why can't you do it?What are the many members of the National Assembly in the welfare developed countries?
"There is a daycare center, and most of them do the house at 4 o'clock.Working moms do the House of Representatives at 4 o'clock with Umi.It's a pity that our love is the last, so everyone goes to the House of Representatives and turns the school with the House of Representatives.Can there be a better quality class by 6-7 o'clock, when ordinary walking parents leave in kindergarten in a daycare center?I would like to create a system that allows you to trust all your parents in a nursery, which is a more safer fence, rather than the school after the House of Representatives.The current extension class says that mothers will go to school by just child care without proper programs.If you run a proper program, do you want to take a leave of absence, take a sitter, send a house, and send private tutoring at 4 o'clock?Why do you want to go late for our kids to be sorry?"
"Because of the use of parenting time, yesterday, the manager was broken and I didn't want to go to work today.Do you not use what's in the plate that you have to create?"
"It's really just this.I want to raise it with my child for a long time.If I just sent a school while I was working, I raised the child?"
Really ... I agree.I hope it is a world where mom and dad can meet the child until 9 o'clock at night.
It's a real sad and sad reality ... Australia seems to be satisfied most of me.
"I don't need money.Please give me time to raise children.I think it is the worst low birthrate solution to increase the night care at 8 o'clock in the morning.Why can't I go home to work quickly?You need to give a special salary to a great person, so you can notice less and go to see your child ..."
"Even if you have a baby, it is not even more and more because of the eyes of the welfare policy company."
Parents who have children and raise them know if they go through a little..Why do you not know why people who make policy?Or do you have a lot of money ???? I don't understand this too…Do you pretend you don't know?
"Wouldn't it be necessary to have my child, not a daycare center or kindergarten, but an environment I can grow?My child is sick, so my mom has to rest, but I noticed the company."
"This is an influential person who wants to say what I want to say ㅎㅎㅎ We are a house that raises the child.On the other hand, did you think it's a little late?When you have a child, patriot patriots around you, but do you really feel practically?Ah ... I didn't have to benefit from it.Even if you are a little far away, you can raise it for a long time if you are an apartment subscription, but you can settle it for a long time, but it will fall off the Seoul Gyeonggi area.This is ... so I don't think I'm alert to the decrease in the population of low birth rates.:) I have a lot of money that I haven't raised myself. I think I know that my life will be good if I apply 100,000 won a month.^^"
"I agree with it violently .. I hope you can do it for a few years even if you are reinstated, even if you are reinstated, how do you raise your baby for a year."
I really want to say something .. I had a second idea before I had a birth.Etc. I have to take it to the hospital.The government will prepare a realistic solution.
"It's so sympathetic TT TT Pediatrics Open Run or Hospital Application Ticketing is good to give birth, but I hope it will be a good environment to raise babies."
Only two hours of shortening work .. I wish I could use it until I was 3-4 years old.
"Approval of work, excess work, and unconditionally.If this is not resolved .. It is not a great help whether it is a holiday, a clay, or a care program, or a care program..And it must also be saved in the office and sitting in the office and slaising executives and executives.It is not a factory to go to the world, but it is necessary to gather together in a world where work is processed as data.Because of the Korean -style braided culture that is obsessed with the form, I noticed that I was raising, raising, going early, and taking a vacation.same"
There's no answer unless you reduce your working hours.
"You sympathize with you…I hope you all have to work at 4:00 while raising a child... !! If the baby is sick, the hospital is worried+ a vacation, a kindergarten rather than a daycare center, but I want to send a kindergarten, but I have to go to a short and caring daycare center, I worry about going to elementary school, and I have no real thoughts."
Even if you are a four -day week or even a shortest elementary child ...
"All pages are full of empathy!The policy for the future children is good, but I think more change is needed for children who are already growing in this low birth rate.It is difficult to recruit children at 3-5 years old, but why is the order of daycare centers?Pediatrics, open runs, parental leave that needs to be used ... Thank you for taking care of the child late, but a society where you can spend dinner with your child can also participate in parenting.If a society where you can have a child is a society where you can have a child and go back, you can solve the low birthrate problem?"
"Wow ... Too too sympathy .... I think that people who are already raised will have to be uncomfortable and happy.When I go to Starfield these days, I think there are more houses that have been brought out than a kid.It's a pity that young people who want to meet their instincts are scary to grow up and grow something.I wish I had a good world to raise ..."
This is the incumbent baby set dad ... You only showed me only the things that really sympathize ... I hope the environment where children who are already born can really make a really a lot.

"Real child care benefits have been so angry since 22 years from 23 years.You may think about it again, but the policy that only supports parts is frustrating."
"@ORMR48 I have to go to work right away, but I got a care teacher, so I got a lot of tears."
"That's right, it's good to care, but I'm tired when adults go out in the morning and come in the evening.What about the children?It is better if you can enjoy dinner with your child and play on the playground before eating dinner.I really need time to spend dinner together"
"So, I'm constantly interested in the precious girls who are already born in this world !!!"
".... I've been pointing out since the late 90's ... My apartment real estate should be raised, newly married couples have to sell expensive, and they have to give birth, and labor costs were passionate and raised.The economy is the first priority, so the working environment was behind the scenes ... I can't get back because it's too late.Sad."
Wow ...Annu ... The mothers now should be happy .. Will there be another mother of the future? ...........
The next generation should be raised by the parents who are already raised.
"It's my heart, it's my heart .... I sympathize ... ㅜㅜㅜ ㅡ ㅜㅜ"
I have a pediatric open -run empathy.
"If you don't have a child, you can't have a second in this country.What is parental leave, I can't take care of me when I'm sick, so I have to use a sitter.There is no answer."
"It's better to have a baby in this country these days, but it's better to have a baby.But it's a good way to live comfortably."
"Wow, I am so sympathetic..ㄱ This is a public service campaign."
Those who have disappeared the sense of reality make the law ??????
"@daldalrae comments Opening feelings .. Elementary school students 1 If you do not notice until the second grade of 1 year, I will leave the second after 4 o'clock every day ^. ^"

"I only say that I don't have a baby, so I only say that I can pay for it.Yogi city is very pathetic and there is no population. I want to reorganize the road."
Please let me go?
"It's really quick to say. If you work during the day and go home at 4 o'clock, it will go up the real birth rate."
"That's right ... My baby's pediatric and diapers are in the nursing room, but my dad can't go in ... How do I go to the hospital without a mother?"
It is a sense of pore !!!It doesn't give you money.You have to make your parents enjoy the joy of raising children more than anyone !!!!Parenting is not pain !!!To be happiness and pleasure !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Iknow, right.Who wants to have a child in a country that doesn't welcome a child.This article is also a reality that only parents sympathize.??"
Maternal protection system users have to be in the labor market.
"If you are a desktop decision, it would be great if you have a public debate."
"It's a single mom, but I can't get the kids school as a punishment..I would like to apply for the kids who are not telling you to give birth."
"Even if the world will not come, he will not give birth haha"
"It was born in November 20, but it started to get out of support from January 21, 21 ...?"

"I'm having a dramatic sympathy ~ I really don't have to say anything because I really think about it ~ ㅎㅎ I want to be a child to be born, but I hope it will be a country that protects children and protects children."
Why are you tears?….
The countryside ... There are no children's children.
"It's too sympathetic .. If you are a politician who politics this problem, you should know how to think about the solution. How much do you know about the reality of parenting?It also costs .. If Korea is no longer money, it would be nice if it is a country that will be solved."
"Oh, it's a very sympathetic post from the standpoint of Aki."
It's really empathy !!Shouldn't the parent child care if they make a quick atmosphere?
"There is no real child, but the pediatrics are strangely tight.In the old days, even if you went to the peak time zone, you could get medical treatment if you wait 30 minutes."

It would be impossible to surge for maternity rates if you have two unemployed parental leave for 1 year of parental leave and 4 o'clock after 4 o'clock.
Really really
"Real .. Completely empathy .. If you create an environment to grow well, you will want to have another baby .. The most important part is not a child care service, but a time for children to take care of them.Giving .. What is it to care for until evening? It is a real care to send parents home early and save their homes."

"It is in the early 30s.There are two reasons for not having a child.At least 300 million to send a child university.It's not even more.In order to be working together, you have to leave your child to the childcare center baby cives' grandparents all day long, and in the end, one person leaves and is full -time.All of the houses that raise children should be forced to work for a short -term work, which is a double -earned or single -earned work.It is necessary to improve the conditions to raise.Even if you are a child, you should not live like that.You have to make you envy.

"There is a daycare center, and most of them do the house at 4 o'clock.Working moms do the House of Representatives at 4 o'clock with Umi.It's a pity that our love is the last, so everyone goes to the House of Representatives and turns the school with the House of Representatives.Can there be a better quality class by 6-7 o'clock, when ordinary walking parents leave in kindergarten in a daycare center?I would like to create a system that allows you to trust all your parents in a nursery, which is a more safer fence, rather than the school after the House of Representatives.The current extension class says that mothers will go to school by just child care without proper programs.If you run a proper program, do you want to take a leave of absence, take a sitter, send a house, and send private tutoring at 4 o'clock?Why do you want to go late for our kids to be sorry?"
"Because of the use of parenting time, yesterday, the manager was broken and I didn't want to go to work today.Do you not use what's in the plate that you have to create?"
"It's really just this.I want to raise it with my child for a long time.If I just sent a school while I was working, I raised the child?"
Really ... I agree.I hope it is a world where mom and dad can meet the child until 9 o'clock at night.
"Even if you have a baby, it is not even more and more because of the eyes of the welfare policy company."
Parents who have children and raise them know if they go through a little..Why do you not know why people who make policy?Or do you have a lot of money ???? I don't understand this too…Do you pretend you don't know?
"I don't need money.Please give me time to raise children.I think it is the worst low birthrate solution to increase the night care at 8 o'clock in the morning.Why can't I go home to work quickly?You need to give a special salary to a great person, so you can notice less and go to see your child ..."
"Wouldn't it be necessary to have my child, not a daycare center or kindergarten, but an environment I can grow?My child is sick, so my mom has to rest, but I noticed the company."
"This is an influential person who wants to say what I want to say ㅎㅎㅎ We are a house that raises the child.On the other hand, did you think it's a little late?When you have a child, patriot patriots around you, but do you really feel practically?Ah ... I didn't have to benefit from it.Even if you are a little far away, you can raise it for a long time if you are an apartment subscription, but you can settle it for a long time, but it will fall off the Seoul Gyeonggi area.This is ... so I don't think I'm alert to the decrease in the population of low birth rates.:) I have a lot of money that I haven't raised myself. I think I know that my life will be good if I apply 100,000 won a month.^^"
"I agree with it violently .. I hope you can do it for a few years even if you are reinstated, even if you are reinstated, how do you raise your baby for a year."
I really want to say something .. I had a second idea before I had a birth.Etc. I have to take it to the hospital.The government will prepare a realistic solution.
"It's so sympathetic TT TT Pediatrics Open Run or Hospital Application Ticketing is good to give birth, but I hope it will be a good environment to raise babies."
Only two hours of shortening work .. I wish I could use it until I was 3-4 years old.
It's a real sad and sad reality ... Australia seems to be satisfied most of me.
"Approval of work, excess work, and unconditionally.If this is not resolved .. It is not a great help whether it is a holiday, a clay, or a care program, or a care program..And it must also be saved in the office and sitting in the office and slaising executives and executives.It is not a factory to go to the world, but it is necessary to gather together in a world where work is processed as data.Because of the Korean -style braided culture that is obsessed with the form, I noticed that I was raising, raising, going early, and taking a vacation.same"
There's no answer unless you reduce your working hours.
"You sympathize with you…I hope you all have to work at 4:00 while raising a child... !! If the baby is sick, the hospital is worried+ a vacation, a kindergarten rather than a daycare center, but I want to send a kindergarten, but I have to go to a short and caring daycare center, I worry about going to elementary school, and I have no real thoughts."
Even if you are a four -day week or even a shortest elementary child ...
"All pages are full of empathy!The policy for the future children is good, but I think more change is needed for children who are already growing in this low birth rate.It is difficult to recruit children at 3-5 years old, but why is the order of daycare centers?Pediatrics, open runs, parental leave that needs to be used ... Thank you for taking care of the child late, but a society where you can spend dinner with your child can also participate in parenting.If a society where you can have a child is a society where you can have a child and go back, you can solve the low birthrate problem?"
"Wow ... Too too sympathy .... I think that people who are already raised will have to be uncomfortable and happy.When I go to Starfield these days, I think there are more houses that have been brought out than a kid.It's a pity that young people who want to meet their instincts are scary to grow up and grow something.I wish I had a good world to raise ..."
This is the incumbent baby set dad ... You only showed me only the things that really sympathize ... I hope the environment where children who are already born can really make a really a lot.
??
"Real child care benefits have been so angry since 22 years from 23 years.You may think about it again, but the policy that only supports parts is frustrating."
"@ORMR48 I have to go to work right away, but I got a care teacher, so I got a lot of tears."
"That's right, it's good to care, but I'm tired when adults go out in the morning and come in the evening.What about the children?It is better if you can enjoy dinner with your child and play on the playground before eating dinner.I really need time to spend dinner together"
"So, I'm constantly interested in the precious girls who are already born in this world !!!"
".... I've been pointing out since the late 90's ... My apartment real estate should be raised, newly married couples have to sell expensive, and they have to give birth, and labor costs were passionate and raised.The economy is the first priority, so the working environment was behind the scenes ... I can't get back because it's too late.Sad."
Wow ...Annu ... The mothers now should be happy .. Will there be another mother of the future? ...........
The next generation should be raised by the parents who are already raised.
"It's my heart, it's my heart .... I sympathize ... ㅜㅜㅜ ㅡ ㅜㅜ"
I have a pediatric open -run empathy.
"If you don't have a child, you can't have a second in this country.What is parental leave, I can't take care of me when I'm sick, so I have to use a sitter.There is no answer."
"It's better to have a baby in this country these days, but it's better to have a baby.But it's a good way to live comfortably."
"Wow, I am so sympathetic..ㄱ This is a public service campaign."
Those who have disappeared the sense of reality make the law ??????
"@daldalrae comments Opening feelings .. Elementary school students 1 If you do not notice until the second grade of 1 year, I will leave the second after 4 o'clock every day ^. ^"
Will that day come ...?
"I only say that I don't have a baby, so I only say that I can pay for it.Yogi city is very pathetic and there is no population. I want to reorganize the road."
Please let me go?
"It's really quick to say. If you work during the day and go home at 4 o'clock, it will go up the real birth rate."
"That's right ... My baby's pediatric and diapers are in the nursing room, but my dad can't go in ... How do I go to the hospital without a mother?"
It is a sense of pore !!!It doesn't give you money.You have to make your parents enjoy the joy of raising children more than anyone !!!!Parenting is not pain !!!To be happiness and pleasure !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Iknow, right.Who wants to have a child in a country that doesn't welcome a child.This article is also a reality that only parents sympathize.??"
Maternal protection system users have to be in the labor market.
"If you are a desktop decision, it would be great if you have a public debate."
"It's a single mom, but I can't get the kids school as a punishment..I would like to apply for the kids who are not telling you to give birth."
"Even if the world will not come, he will not give birth haha"
"It was born in November 20, but it started to get out of support from January 21, 21 ...?"
Will the day come to be a country that raises a child together?
"I'm having a dramatic sympathy ~ I really don't have to say anything because I really think about it ~ ㅎㅎ I want to be a child to be born, but I hope it will be a country that protects children and protects children."
Why are you tears?….
The countryside ... There are no children's children.
"It's too sympathetic .. If you are a politician who politics this problem, you should know how to think about the solution. How much do you know about the reality of parenting?It also costs .. If Korea is no longer money, it would be nice if it is a country that will be solved."
"Oh, it's a very sympathetic post from the standpoint of Aki."
It's really empathy !!Shouldn't the parent child care if they make a quick atmosphere?
"There is no real child, but the pediatrics are strangely tight.In the old days, even if you went to the peak time zone, you could get medical treatment if you wait 30 minutes."
"@junyoung05 Please!this……….Stop making this, stop spraying"
"Wow, where is this tuning?"
"The benefit of having a child and a change every year, and I would like to give me a better benefit now."
"I agree a hundred times.I had a child, but I went through all the written there, and I didn't have a second.I hope you see this post in the National Assembly .. ㅠㅠ"
It would be impossible to surge for maternity rates if you have two unemployed parental leave for 1 year of parental leave and 4 o'clock after 4 o'clock.
Really really
"Real .. Completely empathy .. If you create an environment to grow well, you will want to have another baby .. The most important part is not a child care service, but a time for children to take care of them.Giving .. What is it to care for until evening? It is a real care to send parents home early and save their homes."
I want to say something here!
@loverruth Suddenly this happened.
@Anna_lee_070321 @kmikang @zion_is_onyou @bambbang2__
10 out of 10 pages are all empathy?I don't have money because I don't have money.
"But it's strange ㅠㅠㅠ So there's no low birth rate, so I have to give birth. Why is the place like this place?ㅠㅠㅠ I'm really curious about it ????"
"It is in the early 30s.There are two reasons for not having a child.At least 300 million to send a child university.It's not even more.In order to be working together, you have to leave your child to the childcare center baby cives' grandparents all day long, and in the end, one person leaves and is full -time.All of the houses that raise children should be forced to work for a short -term work, which is a double -earned or single -earned work.It is necessary to improve the conditions to raise.Even if you are a child, you should not live like that.You have to make you envy. Like Europe ??"
"I really agree!Personally, I think that the child is the happiest when raising it with his parents, but I think that the time of work should be faster!"
"@mohw_kr our local pediatric adolescence and hospital, who had only settled down, went out of care until the end of this month."
"It was born in December 18, and since January 19, the first meeting ticket was created ..."
@assdsdas1
@moon1km is this
Not a child who remains late in a real day care center..I hope more children spend dinner with their parents?
"Today I applied for an extension of the daycare center.I applied for caring for 9 months.In the meantime, my parents -in -law has been taking care of it, but I'm not healthy.I'm eager to go to work at 4:00 I can't see"
This toon is the National Assembly.
"Which hearing was it before?I'd rather give me more expensive scores to the people around me, but I think it would be better to change the mood."
@__ee_eeee So why don't you have a diaper in the men's bathroom.
"Nowadays, people often feel that they don't have too much consideration, so there are many times when they don't want to be born.I hope you have a good time with the kids who have been born ..."
"Our kids are ... Children's allowance is 100,000 won generation ㅎㅎ The people who gave birth to the children before that were to say that there was nothing like that, but if you think about it now, if you think about it ...Do you want to raise some percent?"
"@mohw_kr ??Currently, I am 17 months old.Children's career service is 2 children under 36 months.I waited for 8 months, but I want to wait for at least one year from now on.We ask for additional labor costs to care workers who are the first to expand the care personnel and care for care for care for the care of the home."
@__ hyun__k2 Can't you see this country ??
"I live in the United States, but I don't have any support from the state (at least $ 1,000 a month), but I can live a life with dinner.If you work at 8-5 o'clock and bring it to the daycare center, you can spend time with the children until you sleep at 9 o'clock.Of course, I don't notice my mom and dad's leave of absence, but it's mostly 8 weeks.If you have a good job, you are paid, but there are many unpaid.I think it would be more helpful for the Korean government to reduce working hours than money."
"After six days, I'm leaving my baby's nursery and going to work.Working mom is always sorry for children TT, especially if you are sick, you can't take care of it."
I agree so much.I think I need more policies such as guaranteeing time or commuting time than to support when I have a child.I wish there.
"@seungjoon2792 That's right ,,,"

"Catched meat doesn't feed.Because it's your choice, you mean to take care of it"
"I'm giving birth to the second moon .. I'm confirmed with a career break.The child rides a daycare center at 7:50 ... Whenever I get sick, I wait for the hospital for 3 hours and go to the waiting table from dawn ??My parents are all far away and I can't see them for a while, but I often leave the sick babies in the vacation.My husband is at night at night and even when I work at home, it is impossible to live together and childcare.If you want to go early in your 60s from the middle of the 40s who work together, or if you are sick and sick, it is important to say that it is important to say this in this way.I hope it will change from society and work."
"Once you have to give birth, you should raise it."
I agree :) Curry is also a problem.

Really ... I can't even want to get a job.

I hope that the house that raises a baby as a single ear will also benefit from it.
"It's too sympathy…The kid is precious and ridiculous to give birth, but he is a stingy gaze that he feels when he enters a cafe or restaurant.Restaurants who refuse to build a stroller.I only have a kid, but I become the weakest, so I don't want to do it twice."
I agree so much ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
You sympathize with you ??
It was so sympathetic.I always thought like this. I hope it will be a world where you can grow well after having birth.

In the old days, I was crazy to give birth, but now I want to give birth to the hat, I open my hat, kindergarten, and daycare center.I have to run .... But the money is not the money .... Ehu ... I'm just satisfied with the baby doll.This is less money and it seems to be the best of the milk powder diaper."

"This is the right answer…????If you look happy and envious to raise a child, you will have it.If the child was in a first grade, he had a leave of absence, but if he did not take a leave of absence, the child should have been after school and the school."
"You shouldn't let others raise it, and you have to guarantee your parents' time to see the child comfortably. It's money, care, and leave your children in your hands.Isn't it a baby 3 years old ???Smile"
It's too sympathetic ??These are the ideas that have been ordered from one child.
"Please give me 3 million won a month to full -time housewives.Then it can increase the birth rate?!The parental leave system is meaningless.The child is not only painful until 1-3 years, but can be sick at any time.Who is taking care of the hospital when you take it?Double -earned double -earned dual income lives every day."
It's a very reasonable system!
"Oh, no one knows that, but why the hell ..."
"Canada has a lot of households in the evening, and there are many homes that have more than 18 months for parental leave, so many households have 3 or 4 children."
Is it really the right story ????
"Even if you don't have any material support for New York, you can go home early and get a barrier.It's possible to do it early.There are many playgrounds.That's why it's Korean and locals."
It's really empathy ......
I agree so much
Is it too sympathy ??
Really ... I hope you are good at the children who are already born .. ㅠ
Different treatment is too disillusioned with the welfare that the child needs to receive from the income of parents.Why is it influenced by a child born under the condition of parents?
"Huh .. Really .. I'm a three -year -old brother born in 16, 18, and 20 years old. I don't feel like this in the country."
and??
It contains all the reasons for low birthrate here.
I'm really good at politics.
In the country ... even if you apply for it ... more people who don't want to give birth ..
How do you raise a child in a country without a doctor .... ㅠㅠ

"I moved to Seongnam, which is good for raising children, and even here, there are many places without baby chairs in the store."
It's really an extreme empathy.Rather than the time spent on the organization rather than the time spent with children.I hope the family will be fully together.

and!!!I'm really too sympathetic !!!!!
"Really .... It's best to spend time with my child, not to leave the child late."
"It's extra, but you can go to school even if you are sick."
"It's accurate. And I think SNS also plays a part.I think that the children of other people are carrying infants, horses, and for a month, and traveling abroad 2-3 times a year, and the eyes are high, so I think people without children will not be able to handle them.If I have a child when I have a child, can I buy clothes at a department store?I remember thinking."
"If you go home and eat and eat it, it's time to wash and sleep. There's no time to play with your baby on weekdays."
"I sympathized with the first childbirth.After 5 months of giving birth, I was waiting for the daycare center and spending the second daycare center for 13 months."
That's right
that's right??????
Completely empathy !!!The real problem is really too bad ㅠㅠ
ㅠㅠ It's a great webtoon. I agree !!!!I want you to see the children who are already living….
Wow too…sympathy……??A country that doesn't have to be better ??
@inho ___ 86881822
Is it a start now?I can't use it with my lumbar disc?
@sereniti_woo yesterday's what we talked about.
"If you really have a child, it is the end ㅠㅠ"
"I agree so much.It's hard to have one, but I can't even dream of two three."
"I also raised 2 people and raised one son, and I was working, but I agreed."
I don't know what's the problem and make a policy ??
Honestly this is the answer
It's not important for a child to have an institution until 8 o'clock ... The working environment to raise a child is more important ... TT TT TT Mom and Dad make money all day and the child is in school all day long.
@Wany__park Why do I do it?
Would you like to be able to join the after school where you can have dinner with the Aegons?
I agree .. Subsidies also require user research !!
I sympathize with it so much ㅠㅠㅠ I hope you can go to work and go to work in your House of Representatives.
Most or most parents will eat rice with their children and try to spend their leisure time.Did you make it work comfortably?The best country?Is it like this?
Too sympathy .... ????
Nuclear empathy ??
The fact that there are more jobs that cannot be used than a job that can take parental leave ....
"I live in my husband's job where I was away from my family's family, and thanks to this reality, I will soon move near my family and get a couple of couples with my husband."
"Ironically, I can send my parents home early, but I always have a spring class until night to hold onto the children and work more ???????"
"I was so very, so, so, so I didn't know it before I had a baby, and I didn't touch it.I'm really upset ... I don't have any money giving me a child .. ㅠㅠ It's so important to create an environment where you can grow up !!!!"
Sincerely sympathy .. ????
This ...
Is it right ???????
"Do not feed the fish you caught ??I have three, but it's just a pity that there is no benefit."
Really ...
"I don't notice dinner, but I think it's going to be a lot of postpartum vacation and a child's pain or a school event.There are also multi -national children in the fertility rate now, so the population will be reduced after the adults are actually adults."
It's only a zoo because it's only the area where you have two kids as a plus.
"I agree, I don't want to leave my child in kindergarten with such a system like spring and after school.I would like to create a environment that can be a dinner together."
@kkyeong2s I talked when I went to the Czech Republic
I sympathize with you !!!!!!
Rather than getting care until 8 pm .. ㅠㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ
@flower.moni sympathy!(Don't care for care.
"My Eval ... Please give birth to people who don't want to have a baby.So, I'm happy even if I have a baby, you are respected, you have to feel it."
"These days, I really respect those who are born and raised."
"It is a total difficulty. I would like to take the policy direction so that it is possible to make a very natural family relationship, even if it takes a long time, even if it takes a long time to get married, if you get married, if you get married."
"I only have two people in the department ... I have to take my job during the maternity vacation, so I noticed that I really noticed ... I feel like a baby ..."
"Oh, it's a nuclear sense ~ It would be better to see the child who was born happily.ㅜㅠ Parents have to raise their children.If you give birth, it will give you money…It is good to give money, but it doesn't give you money.If you are not sure, you can just follow the advanced countries."
I want to press a hundred pieces !!!!!It's a shame that I can't press the empathy once ... !!!!
"Reality…If you give birth, you are not a patriot but a sinner who can't get a job."
"..Sadly, it is never a country that wants to have a child"
"I'm a patriot, this is right"
I talked to my husband a few days ago and talked about it.Do you not give you a lot of meat?Is it right
"I said every day too…I agree so much .. ??Why are the children who have been born?If you have a good idea to raise your baby, you will have people who have not had a baby yet.Instead of the national public, the childcare center is open to the small neighborhood.Why is it not free education for daycare?It's not a bit of a lot of money.It's really frustrating ??"
A child who is already born behind
I feel so sympathetic .. ㅠㅠㅠ I feel a lot of this year.
I want to raise my child directly ...
"Oh, I'm sad."
"These days, there are a lot of low birth rates, but it's too sympathetic .. ????I hope a policy is helpful in reality. The reality is that there is no place to have a kindergarten and even the hospital."
"Ha .. Today, it is a night that allows you to go to the kindergarten alone."
@k_i_y.84 Really acknowledged .....
Yuna has no children
"If you see my baby two or three hours a day, it makes sense.I look at the child's face with a smile brightly."
This is the most sympathetic article among the low birthrate reasons!It is essential to reduce working hours and create an environment where parents can raise children together !!
ㅡ ??????
I hope you can spend time with your child and have dinner together !!! ????
"I thought it would be better than Sanobi when it was gongnobi, but it wasn't."
I want to have a child and want to work.
"It's too sympathy.After the biggest problem, the situation has changed.I closed the door of the daycare center with low birth rates, but I didn't have any places to send.I wanted to get a job, so I went to the interview, and the kid was so young."
Empathy 100
It's so sympathy .. ㅜㅜ
"The reality is also a reality, but the second is given up quickly ........ ??"
You have to make money to raise your child well.
"It is too sympathetic.I'll see you in the country, so don't work like a dog until late in the evening."
I have everything I want to say. The most heart torn is when the child is sick.Do you want to leave a sick child to a stranger ????????
"that's right.I am a mother and a 5 -year -old mother and office worker, but the child was a little big, but it is still difficult to raise a child.It's really frustrating to try to have a child when you create a country that grows well.Even if a child is a little bigger, it's hard to grow and spend more money."
It's not going to be careful for caring time.
"Looking at the environment that is born and raised now, I have to make my heart.If you tell me to give birth, you will be able to fold your heart that is hard to live around you. Who wants to have?"
"There's no place to leave your resume every time. I understand the company's position, but when I get sick or when I have a vacation, my child must be a middle school student."
Someone said that ... I'm a sinner at home because I'm a walking mom at home.
"Wow! Is it empathy a hundred times ??It's been six years since I left my child to my parents who had less than a hundred days.The economy is difficult because the economy is difficult, and it is hard to pay for the company.I think this is necessary ㅠ Nara, please help your walking."
I'm so sympathetic to see the article.
"After six days, the kid is usually 8 months to 9 months.At this time, the pickup time is 3-4 o'clock.7:30 if you go home after work.The three to four hours of the blanks should be filled without the help of parents, and even if you leave it in the hands of others, you can only hug the baby on the weekend.I don't know if reinstatement makes sense without the help of parents.If a person who leaves in infertility or a baby enters a new company in a new company…It's busy to adapt, but it's hard to understand even if it's happening because of the child.I would like to be able to return to career -breaking girls because I can raise enough to be as possible.At least 4 years is a gap…I think it's too far to return to social life."
"If you want to have a child, if you don't have a baby, you want to adopt it."
@n.ichan_ijun_father ??
How did you organize my thoughts so neatly?!I hope this feed will spread widely!????
Would it change more than 10 years to be more serious?
I agree with the exact cause analysis.
I completely agree.
Yuk Huis is a system that is so good.
"I don't need it when I leave it, but I need to be comfortable with my child ~~"
@Dokusung89 ㅋ ..
I'm also talking about open runs.
"I got out of my parents and had my child, but I had to open my hands to my parents because of the child, and if my child was so big, I would borrow my hands."
That's right ㅜㅜ You shouldn't have to worry when you are already born.
"There are no children in the province, so the daycare centers are closed. Is there 41 people in Seoul?I'm curious ~"
"I can't figure out what the problems are, and the reality is painful."
?????????????????????????????
@p.ebeen and I really agree with them ...
ㅠㅠ The child was able to eat dinner together rather than staying up to 8 o'clock in the day care center or school.
@Cheongwadae_korea @Cheongwadae @gov_korea @theassemble_kr @moGEFKOREA_OFFICIAL I hope you can.
@kki_soyoung empathy
"I agree .. I had the first child, but the second, the more I think this is not this."
You have to take care of the kids who are born again.
Everybody informs the actual comments like this ㅋㅋ Do I have to tag the president ... ㅋㅋㅋ
"I went to the interview, but rather than asking me, I only asked if the baby was looking at it.."
Did you tell me the fundamentals?
"When I had a child, I became a sinner when I had a baby."
I don't really do it until 8 o'clock.
"Ah ... really sympathetic ??Daily life that your family can have dinner together ??Care is a better policy than now, but I hope it is a country where you can expect a better future ... ??"
"Shouldn't the dad/mother be able to go home early and “care” rather than “care” that cares for children at school until 8 pm.The child grows up with the interest, love, and touch of parents, but rather, the system made upside down is so sad.It's hard to stay until 8 pm at work, so it's too hard for children to stay at school until 8 pm."
The child who is already born is a country behind the scenes…@Feeled
I really agree.??
"I'm a friendly family, so I can't call it even if I'm in a hurry."
200%empathy ??????
@hakkai0921 ovarian is an ovarian band.under...
"Even if you reinstate 3 months after the first admissions, the contract expires."
I agree so much. Why are you already born?
"Wow, it's so creepy and empathy because it's the same as I think."
"I planned to put it before I gave birth, but I raised one as a double income, and I couldn't feel it for the second time I was worried about it."
"I want to say something. I don't have any problems with powdered milk, diapers, or clothes right now."
"So, the kids, the parents should be happy, or the prospective parents are likely to make 2 world planning or not."
Too sympathy ㅠㅠ
I agree too much ??
The child who is already born is going to work back and forth ... sincerely !!!!!!!
I agree too much ??Do you think you draw me ????????????
"ㅋㅋ That's right ㅋㅋ My friends also raised their kids, but I declared that I would not have a baby."
"While studying in the United States, I gave birth to three children and came to Korea for a while, but I noticed a lot and returned to the United States after listening to the words, ""Mom is greedy.""At the airport, the stroller is fast ... Then I arrived in the United States, but I am so grateful and good for the country where children prioritized.I really agree with the expression that the child is the country behind it."
It's a real dramatic sympathy.
"I really agree.I would like to support the system that can take a leave of absence to one of the first grade parents, rather than always spring.The children are so sad.I would like to spend the afternoon with my parents at home, not at school."
"That's why if you think about the future, I want to not vote more ~~ I want to make a vote when I will make a real country."
This is steamed .. ????????
"If you give money only when you are born, who will give birth to people these days.Open Run…Open Run…If you don't have a place to go to a daycare center or kindergarten, you can go to the bus or self -tier, regardless of the neighborhood where I live, and if you go in elementary, middle, and high school, the million won is ridiculously broken.??When the parents are preparing for retirement !!!!"
I really agree !!!
????????It's a very sympathetic story
"After birth, I worry about my child.I feel guilty that my mother will not be with me for a long time.There is no consideration at work at work.The public education collapsed and the two -earned schools have no friends in the playground.I want to have the second time I want to have it, but I have a big child and I have to think about my age."
I agree entirely
It's really sympathetic.
Wow this
"The children who were born and their parents showed a lot of happy families to the world, that would be the best low birthrate.do?I don't know why people who are making low birthrate measures are so dreamy."
Really 100000 Pro ????
It's a war behind the child who was already born.
The policy to increase the time to increase the time.
The close -up couple are in the second year of Aegi Elementary School.My future ... Huh .. ????? ♀?
"Now, the birth rate and results of our country have become the realm of “curiosity”, not the realm of crisis.I wonder how far it will fall and what will happen, but I don't have a sense of crisis, and I don't know the politicians who run the national affairs on this issue, and I'm not interested.The commando must be able to apply for a homeless person (if you are attempting to prepare my first home), and you need to make a variety of methods, such as increasing the lottery, lowering the tax rate, and increasing the chance of winning the lottery... It won't happen.Because everyone takes care of their vested interests"
"Asset Working Mom.I noticed the company's eyes on the side of the day, and I noticed that I could hear the sound of my neighbor's restaurant."
"Thank you for drawing this cartoon.I hope there are a lot of people who must see a cartoon with these messages ~ Please keep drawing a lot!(Oh, and it should be called low birth rates-> low birth life."
Really bone !!!!It's the same as I had to eat with the bridegroom while eating dinner. I don't have a baby because I don't have money.
"I live in Germany, but I really agree ..."
"Really, too sympathy ????"
"I want to say what I want to say ... Even though my family is living near my house and watching my baby, I have a lot of hands.I don't feel how to raise it ... To my colleagues, to my sinful children, sinners to my parents ... Second is an unprecedented ..."
This cut is the National Assembly !!! ??????
"I hope you have made time with your family, not the kids takes up until 8 o'clock.Everyone's family should be happy."
Complete nuclear ball !!I always talked to the bridegroom.
"It's a group of assets, so it's not a school until 7:30. There's no answer."
"The problem is money ... You have to reduce the money you give to the salary patients.If you go to the hospital with a cold, we usually guide you outside the 5,000 won.And if you can't get a shot or ring gel, it's 1.20,000 won, and if you go to the emergency room, 100,000 won is ridiculous.In the country, hundreds of thousands of won will be given to the hospital.That is the medical insurance that we always tear off in salary.Pediatrics open run?That's because our country has a good medical insurance.How about a cough and coughing .... I have to develop the power to overcome myself, but I can't send a daycare center.It is more demanding to select a thousand patients or the salary patient, and it should be taken out of the benefits that the lives of the cold body should be taken out of the benefits."
".. TT TT When the neighboring society was activated, I naturally raised a child together."
Wow ... so sympathy
"Even if the salary is a little reduced .. 10-4 o'clock, so that you can use it without notice by work ... I would take the daycare center and I could pick it up."
I agree ????????
I sincerely admit it.
"I put my application to get a job again after 7 years of career, but ... Gwangmal ... The screening girl is only huge ... No one is welcoming.Did you have a breakthrough? I didn't care about how many kids are, and I only talked about my career.When I started working, all the company systems were able to go to the company well in the company.It is a system that can work flexibly if it is not filled with time.In Korea, the low birth rate will be solved by changing this."
"????????Now, my mother's mother is happy. Why is there a lot of laws for a baby?"
I am so sympathetic
"It's hard to take care of childcare, but it's different from school."
That's right.
I think we need to guarantee the weekend time to be together and get rid of the word of really socially disgusted and mamchung.
"That's right.The elderly on the road also ask, but it's actually nothing and it's hard to receive ....."
"Now, there are few real benefits of our second third."
"@sukyeol.yon @2_jaemyung @mins_moj I don't know if the president of the president of the National Assembly will see this real childcare grievance and try to prepare alternatives.I think it's a good place to listen directly.I am just a parenting heart, which is just a normal citizen."
That's right
Do you really agree with all the words ??
"Today, I dragged the car and went to the train, but it was a breakdown in the elevator."
Parenting of our country is the fresh play of the rich……??
I will notice one person every day.
"If you always have a spring school, you can work more."
A world that is really hard as a bulb ...
"It would be nice if a culture of male boss mental that I had been on vacation was a culture that could have been settled!The male staff is struggling, but you have been on vacation.I really want to be a 2 -year -old baby for a week."
"But now the children will live with a good quality life that is different.Much bigger opportunities will be as much as the reduced competition.It will be a small number of young people in the country that has become the most richest country since its founding.Even if it's hard, I hope you go well.The Future is Friendly and Promising."
"I agree so much, but I don't think there's a good time to go home.The purpose is to increase the working hours even if you look at what you have during the election.Do you have to work on your parents, to work overtime, and to get a childcare gap?And the policy direction is to try to treat it cheaply in spring.The kids who have been born are the country that does not care."
It's a real nuclear sense.
"What should parents who have not received preferential benefits?If you give birth late, preferential benefits get better and do you think?When you are busy and hard to eat when you are disconnected from your workplace, is it not the best preferential to live with your family without money preferential?After my child, my mother also has a career in his career, but it's hard to find Alba."
@juuri__h I see this .. I'm really sad.
It's a government that even the kids who are born can not care about what they believe and give birth.
"Children finishes at 4 o'clock to solve the problem of low birthrate if they leave work together or get sick when they are sick.I raised it.If you get sick in a row, you are as short as ten days.It's a month long.Rather than getting a job, I can't even dream of part alba."
"That's right.I don't know it's a difficult world to raise a child, but I'm trying to solve it with money rather than improving the environment.I don't think I'm seeing the essence ..."
"If you give birth, it is hard to give birth."
I think it's so bone and I think it's really a real writer.
I really agree with Korean characters ㅜㅜ ??????????????
??sympathy??…
Please give me time to empathize.
I think that the parents who have a child have a happy birth rate will go up.It's hard to cry and be a parent ... Why are the parent's general meeting again?
"If you don't have a double -ear, you can't have a child, but if you work, you can't have a child."
It's really right.
I'm preparing for my heart because I want to have a child.
Real omma dads should shorten working hours and spend time with children ㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ I would like to allow me to allow me to raise my child ... so that I can grow in the arms of my family rather than being on the outside for a long time outside.!!!!Is it too sympathetic?
"The salary is not reduced, but it will solve a lot of problems even if only the time of work is faster.If you look at it, you have a woman because you have a love for a woman."
"I really agree!I always want to take care of the spring classroom, but I hope there are many jobs that can be done with parenting or flexible workplace so that they can be with their mother at home."
"The apartment home daycare center is under the house, but it is salty to see it until 10 pm because it is night class."
"It seems that the system itself is not good for motivation for childbirth.It will not come out of the lifetime, but it will continue to come out.After mothers, they do not break the dumplings and not noticed and work stably, but they should have a system that can be seen enough for children.I want to have detailed welfare even when I go to children.For example, for example, after work, I hope that the child's welfare of the time with his parents after work or the sickness of one child is a fundamental system that makes the working double -parent sinner @100__gram__ sympathetic?"
"After finishing the company at 4 o'clock, the country doesn't go back……...."
@eunmi_104 I am very sympathetic now
I really agree so much !!!! ??
I agree so much ~~ ??
"Too empathy.In particular, after sending a child to elementary school, I became a school child, and I had no benefits, and the school was only done and all child care was at home !!!Even our school has no care, but I can't apply for private education, so I can't get any educational expenses even though I run a special lecture on vacation during vacation.If you go to the company, you have to take it out and take it out.I don't have to say that I don't have a child in this reality because I delete it all over the individual.The children's environment is not improved now ..."
I cared for it when I was in the first one ... 7 years later.Please listen to your parents ..
"Oh, I really agree"
Sympathy
"01 ""= ^= ????????????????????????????"
JEG XCVX7 Savior.
I sympathize with the school and the aftercare.It's a natural pattern to run the school after school.
It's all right .... I have a real life and all the right words .....
Is this a country ?????????????
"Even if the sun goes beyond the mountains, the children who can't go home will have this, why not express me at the same time, but in Korea, where a child should be as big as me, it will be engraved on the bones.There is no one who wants to give birth to fill the head of the Korean people like a chicken born to give birth to only eggs in the poultry farm.It's a pity.Besides, this worry seems to be only parents who are young children ..."
"It's really right.If you give me the hope that you can live well and take care of the middle and high school students who are going to school, you will get married and have a child."
That's right. It's right to let go of the child. Increase the time to work and increase the child care time.
"This is ... I don't know that smart people don't know, but it's just cloudy ... ㅠ"
"Send your parents to your home, don't cut your money, don't notice, and it's cheaper.If you want to go to the country, I think it should be supported as a staff member of the country.The daycare center is not powerful."
"If you take good care of the real children ... No, if you know where the mothers are uncomfortable in real life and take care of that part, the birth rate will rise a little .... ??"
"The first is difficult, the first is to think of the first, but if you grow it, it is hard to give up in this reality."
The father who wants to see the baby cried on the subway that he went home after night work.
Do you want to press it many times ??????????????????????
sympathy ????
"I agree so much!First of all, a multi -person girl enjoys cultural life, and even if you apply for one after -school, your waist is bent ...."
"@ijn_78 Please take care of the people who have already given birth.?My daughter is born in December 21, so I can't get my parents' salary.There will be more people who will already be born and have more people than those who are born in the future;You only get married ㅠ don't have a baby ^^"
I agree so much.
"ㅜㅜ really, everyone is going, but why not change"
It's hard for anything.
The child is three.This is not caused by low birth rates.Children who already exist are encouraging the people's desk head policy to encourage the people to encourage low birth rates.The child ... a multi -child ... It wasn't a country where I could raise children with disabilities ... I also like it because I was kids around me ... I want to promote my child .. ....
@chongo.o sad reality ??
"Yes, I'm thinking about pregnancy.Even though I am a civil servant, I noticed parenting time for maternity protection time."
ㅠㅠ ㅠㅠㅠ Dog empathy
You have to increase the year and reduce your working hours. There is no time for yourself. How do you have a baby?
This is really natural .... Why are you sad ㅠㅠ ??
"It is not a show support, but you have to build the necessary system.ㅠㅠ I'm going to prepare for my old age or hard ... Ehyo"
"I was so happy to give birth and nurture it, but I can't force or recommend it to anyone.I think it's right to have only those who will be raised with real love"
Where should I get right?
"It's a teaching daycare. I'm using shortening parenting.There's a lot of support ... I still have a long way to go to the low birthrate ... I know someone who has been born ... I know that the upper line is not struggling, so I know that the child is walking in six months.No ..."
"My parents should be able to go home early ... ""I'll take care of the child by 7 o'clock, or by 8 o'clock !!!!!""Is this right???"
"Please do it, but don't just tease your mouth and run it."

There's no diaper for the men's bathroom?I never thought about it ..!
@yourchannce_It's not easy ??

Is it really empathy ????It's not easy to live in a working mamdadi
"I have to rest for 3 months and reinstate, but I am scared to leave it to my baby's daycare center.As soon as I was born, I was a separated family.This is too strange to be a grandparent benefit that looks at the baby."

I hope people who make this policy have seen it properly.This is really reality ㅠㅠ ??
@93_JUNGHWAN Really reasons why I sympathize with this article fiercely these days ....
"Oh, I agree with my couple's thoughts and scary."
"I need a system that might be a child ... If it doesn't work, I have to bring in foreign names like Singapore ..."

"Unconditionally have a baby, get married, the government will apply for it.This doesn't mean.Not young people who haven't married yet.It is good to have policy support for those who raise existing children and that they are married, married, and live.It's okay.This social atmosphere is created so that young people want to get married and have a child.It is difficult for people who raise children to raise their education.What do you like?Will you marry?In addition to those who have not tried in the first place, they support people who raise existing children and change social awareness to improve."
"The method is actually simple .. You can create a family -oriented society like the United States. You can close the restaurant early and reduce the fun.It's hard to give up my life .... come to the United States.There's no jam of jam late night. In the end, I have a baby ..."
I will have a dual-working environment ㅠ 10-5 o'clock.
The government is going to lose cattle again and fix it?
"If the price of the house is lowered, it would have a baby"
"In order to solve the low birth rate, it must have a child. The extinction of the state. It is necessary to present an unemployment proposal rather than this crisis remarks.Low fertility and chartered fraud laws are behind the scenes, and there is a long time ago that the crazy lawmakers can solve only their own rice bowls.Can.Just as we cover the issue with greater issues, it becomes a big issue if we react more to priority issues such as low birth rates or charter fraud.Eventually, the government and lawmakers move according to the core, so if we make the issue bigger, we can move them."
It seems to be the number one school teacher who will disappear
Why is rice?Work too?Is the mourning woman raising it ??So don't give birth ...
"I moved to a job where I could work from home and reinstated in six months.The reason is that when I go to work every day, I have to get a baby somewhere, but I had to take a year -long parental leave, and I was burdened by the loan for a year.So six months have been transferred and reinstated, and my vacancy is filled with my mother.The situation is very good, so it's possible to work with work and parenting, but the placenta is not like me.To send a baby to the daycare center, you have to raise one year, but the income is too small.I don't have a person who can see it again.How do you send a daycare center after that?Every day, the mother and dad must leave the baby from 8:00.When you come back home, you will be 7 o'clock, and if you do the house at 3 o'clock, you should have someone to help you.If you work only one of your parents, you can eat and live, or you have to make a hard time, or one of them is one of them.In this situation, who will have a baby and make a family ... I think I was so happy and good at having a baby.Where is it wrong?"
"If you get married, men and women are also a dog and a girl."
"Korea becomes very uncomfortable when you baby!As soon as you become a mother, you should notice the company, and the hard woman is in the sky to find a job, and the private tutoring expenses in the entrance hell, the price of the house is very expensive, and the school width is punished.Korea is too hard.So it doesn't seem to be born!"
But the number of elementary school students would have already been decided seven years ago. It would have been a foreseen future.
"Um ... I think the most problem is house price.In the old parents' generation, the criteria that were not living well and living were not very different, but there was no difference.The apartment charter, which is likely to talk about 100 million degrees, would be able to talk about any man who had almost 300 million people in Gyeonggi -do.W will the woman like that will be from 100 to 10 percent in the number of Korean population.Korean culture is a very strong country, so even if you are a villa, you will be better than a villa.I just wanted to talk about it, so the biggest problem is that it is the current economy of Korea, which is difficult to prepare a charter apartment even if you have a ridiculous house, but a ridiculous house."
"@song_yi_s2 If you do something for those who have already produced it, is it right to see it positively?It gives you a baby right now!How much do you give!If you try to see the people who are already born and raised, you are worried about it."
"Do not support young people, but get married and support people who are children"
"People in their 50s and over have a vested interest in Korea (politics, real estate, etc.) The younger generation is too difficult for the younger generation to raise the status at this point.I'm busy .. Now I'm going to block the low birth rate ~ It's serious and serious."
The members of the parliamentary members are not concerned about the ruin of the country while fighting with only pockets.
"At first it was a house problem, but now everything is in a state.Various crime -to -criminal offenses of various criminals, etc.It seems to be this birth rate."
"In the old days, like a grandfather's generation, please be a country.Children are not those who are paying for the future."
"Well, I saw a lot of women who only played the crab."
"From the term of office of the government, children's rapid decline .."
All of them are opposed to the Nokids Zone.
"Seoul is like that..There are more than 30 people in a new town, and there are up to 14 classes in first grade.ㅜㅜ"
I don't know why I don't have to look at the comments.Let's just want to do it....
"According to experts, I can't overcome it .... Even if the kids born now do all the births later, they can't recover. Of course, if they have 5-7 people like the old days ...The country's economic structure is ruined by young people to support the elderly."
If you want to strengthen your local medical gardens?Should I wipe or push people on the subway until someone sits?
Wasn't the house price so much to reduce the marriage rate ????
"I know it's serious, but the reality is more serious. You have to create a little bit of the environment."
"So the children born now are important, but please take care of the children born !!!!!"
"Since the elderly are a vote, only the elderly policy is just a look .. ^^"
"If you are not particularly bad for people who are born and grow, please do a low interest rate if you are not particularly bad."
"This is the responsibility of which governments. Why can't you say this?It's the responsibility of our people.I can't do it because I can't do it. I was trying to do it, but I was trying to do it.But our people are wrong, so we have to reflect on it."
"Anyway, politicians are not interested in population reduction or birth rates.Since the number of elderly votes is much more than youth marks, only the commitments of the elderly will be announced and the policy will be the elderly.I'm two kids too, but there's no answer.Even if you want to raise the age of public transportation or pensions, the elderly will be upset, and the next voting is obviously influenced."
"How do you give birth and send school? ... It's a little different to be a little different, and if you want to be in the world, you have to tear it, and you have to be dying or divorce, but I don't know how to do it.Give birth .. What is the developmental support right now ..."
Low fertility will not be solved ... people in their 50s and 60s who make policies make a policy without any understanding why their 20s and 30s do not have children.I don't understand.This problem will never be solved because each other does not understand each other.
"I can't use house prices, school expenses, and too much work."
There are so many schools that are so far away.
What should I do? I don't want to have a slave
"I know it's a serious problem.It is not easy to handle, so living alone, people who live alone"
"The government is also a government, but when you see other children's children, you may not want to have a baby."
No ㅋ ㅋㅋㅋ I really don't know why the real birth rate is low ???
Extinct Jam ㅋㅋ There aren't many people who can read in 150 years.
Elementary school is abnormally high
The answer is !!doesn't exist!!Do you live ??
Who do you mean that society has done so ... It's a hard time to build a family in a difficult time even in a country where there is no resource in a country where there is no resource in a small land.ㅠㅠ

"I don't know how to solve low birth rates, but I'm pouring out only money, but I don't know where the money is, and the older generation will change to change."
Trying to lower the suicide rate should increase the birth rate.
You have to create an environment where the government can struggle.It is hard to agree with any baby.Which humans will have a lot of children to make money and go into the kids?
"Don't whine if you are maternity, but please solve the problem."

I'm happy because of my child, but I have a lot of pain and frustration.The current Korean society seems to be 1+1 = -0.5…"
"If you go to a new city in the metropolitan area, it is 10 and half per year.20 people in half.There are many new complexes or school districts around such schools.In such a place, newly -married couples and young children are gathering.It's not all about Seoul.If you are a non -school district or villa village for old construction, the school is about 2.3 and half per grade, and even less than 20 students per class.Now, even though they have children, young people are gathering into new complexes or new towns.The same is true for school districts."
"I think the future will be brighter to support the children who were born well, not the children to be born."

"All election pledges try to increase birth rate, but there is nothing better."

"It is a low birth rate solution, and there are only women related to women."
@leeseolae_ Jihyo is a 17 -year -old
"The way to solve low birth rates, real estate, jobs, and overcrowding in the metropolitan area is to save the province.Of course, it will take a long time and there will be trial and error, and everyone must yield little by little, but ultimately, the country must develop when it is developed.Even if the president changes, even if the ruling party changes, the policy stance does not change and consistently lasts 10, 20, and 30 years.10 million won for having a baby?It doesn't give birth.When I went to the entrance ceremony yesterday, last year, there were 100 students in 100 students this year and 29 people in the side of the neighborhood.Who gives money to give money to give you a cheap loan?"

Politicians do not seem to be interested in much interest or worry about it.
"I am a mother who entered elementary school.Our school district has 50 students in first, and there are more than 30 people even after second grade."

It is more correct to think about maintaining even children who are born without thinking of overcoming low birth rates. People's values ??and thoughts are not easy to change
I don't have to blame others.But why don't you have a child?
Why can't we go in line ㅑ ㅡ ㅡ!

"However, Korea is close to the kindergarten, so there is no kids' ride, so if you go to the cafe, you eat brunch and ignore the hearts, ignoring the hearts, and go to society.It's more worse than my house, but what's the hell of being lazy?"
Increasingly low birth rate.

"Born in 16 years. Last year, there were 108 freshmen."
"Nowadays, there are more elderly protection areas than children's protection zones"
Ooh ... Our neighborhood has an elementary school.
Those children pay 35%of the national pension ????????????
The house with a child would have made some commute adjustment until the child became an adult.
Double -earning increases labor supply and acts as a downward pressure on wages.
"Our local elementary school is overcrowded, so sports meetings are divided into days.I have a lot of classes, so it's fierce after school. I have to wait for more than 3 hours of pediatrics. And my personal thoughts are young, but I don't want to do hard parenting, and I can't stand it even if it's a little hard.I want to tell you other views ..."
"It's really a big deal ... unless there is innovative and realistic policy and alternatives, the low fertility rate will not change to fertility rate ... ㅠㅠ"

A country with less patients than doctors ??????
"I'm a father in my late 30s who lives with two children. I have only 100 million assets, but I'm a small and medium -sized company, but my son and daughter are so happy to be happy to be a government support plan.The first thing that did well in life would have given birth and raised children TT TT If you want to live better than others, compare them, put them down, and are satisfied with my family."

"The Unjeong New Town is overflowing with the kids, so even if the hospital is open, it will be more than an hour of waiting, and there are no children's house or one child."
"@poppopblue, etc.So you don't have to be more struggling. You have to go through pregnancy and childbirth so you can know the weight, so you will understand someone.The institutional support of the country is obvious, but I think that the perception of the members of society should be changed together."
Are you alpha?
Korea is a country that is difficult to grow and raise
"The law makes men unhappy and society is a consumable machine, so men don't get married.Fairly from the army, they go to both men and women and stop having a disgust for men."
"I still think it's going to fix it.They don't worry.There are no problems in their lives, and their descendants will not have a big blow ... ㅋ"
"The woman had to be baby, childcare, cleaning, laundry, money, and daughter -in -law."
It's a lot of men's money to play while playing.
It's a lot of men's money to play while playing.
"I thought it was an old magazine scrap, but in 2006, it is said that it is emerging as a serious problem."
Why are you opposing the nursing home in the closed place ?? ㅠㅠ
The problem is that it varies from region to region.
"I'm fighting here, so I'm going to get married and have a baby .. ??"
Looking at the comments haha
Isn't the couple's choice?!Do you have to say that someone should have a child?!Should the government should give money……
"If you ask to make welfare conditions that can be married and strange, Korea will be driven to welfare red"
A society that notices that the kids cry when they take off and lands ...
"Is there a woman who doesn't have a baby if you can raise money alone even if you make money alone?It is hard to pay for water, so it is hard to pay.But for a woman, it's hard to work and work.If you are suddenly open in kindergarten, you have to go to your mother.And even if you are still working, it is a housework, a childcare, and a woman wants to add to it."
"More than 200 students in 6th grade, but from the fifth grade, 100 students and the first grade are 110"
Sex ??
"Uh, in our school year, there are up to 17 classes in each class."
"You must help people who are born, not those who are born."
@51_posity

I graduated from 40 students in wool school this year and I came in 12 students.ㅜㅜ
"There are 18 freshmen in the metropolitan area?Is it not one class, but 18 freshmen students? ;;;;; Ome ~~~"
It is not easy to make a child who is overflowing with the happiness of life compared to the life of a comparison.
The more problem is that I can't realize this situation and just find myself to live.
Yes
"This is because medical privatization and governments' expansion of medical privatization and governments are the most anti -face -to -face medical treatment.It is judged that non -face -to -face care is a medical privatization policy for their money. In the meantime, the government's attempt to legislate non -face -to -face has not crossed the National Assembly .Https: //www.newstomato.com/one/view.aspx?

I'll sell the country next year

Give me a house when you get married
You can vote well.

Just Moon Jae -in
"I would like to lower the household income tax, the national pension tax rate."

"@fkalrla101601 But not all. In the case of a new city, there are many overcrowded schools."
I don't fix the barn.
"In the old days, only one child was advertised, but nowadays, he advertised TV to have a child."
Do you have any recommendations for elementary school teachers?What are you doing every year
"The ultra -low child asked yesterday. What is my house?What is my house?Why are you curious about that?When I asked, I didn't know that I couldn't answer because I didn't know the friends at school. From the first day of the new semester, I was embarrassed, such as the difference in the collapse of the argument, and I would have to live my life while comparing each other.It's also an uneasy life of tomorrow"
Is it destruction?
Real kids aren't too old ??
Why are you going to divide gender here?
"I have to work with pregnancy, but I have to give birth ..."
"If you war, people die a lot, so you can rebuild Korea and give birth.I have to go to war in North Korea."

"Well, if you give birth to a house, you have to go home in the country."
Many elementary and secondary universities that will close in the future are already in front of you.
Let's have a child with a house ????
The policies from the heads of the 586 of the left -handed totalitarianism who did not study ... What are you doing ... it's frustrating.????????

older brother!!How about going to the National Assembly for the country?
"If you have a baby in the first place, the family can be destroyed, but if you are married, if you get married, it is impossible to recover 100 million policies, education, house prices, women's parental leave guarantee, and even if you can live as a foreigner,The house price exceeds 1 billion in the plate, so how to buy a house and give birth to a baby"
"Even if you are a house price, you have to be cheap."
"A few years ago, I think I saw an article about 100 million to 300 million."
"Unless the fundamental problem is solved, I will continue to come up with that policy."
I don't know that private education costs are murderous.
ㅋㅋ Completely sympathetic
I think it would be possible to make a policy that would be in touch.
Isn't it because of the 500%house price ... ??????
It's more effective than that.I need a big benefit to envy.
I am one person who doesn't understand the disaster subsidies ...
"I agree very much.It's a baby three mom, and every time I see legislative policies, I have a sigh.I don't have a child because I can give up like that ..."
It should be noted “maximum” lol
Turbo should also have a baby and be a patriot ~~~ ^^ ????
"The price of apartments is the largest.Hong Kong, New York, London, is much more than Seoul.It is easily solved by removing the charter system and raising a lot of multi -homeowners.The charter system is over six years ago, but I don't understand why I don't get rid of it."
??????
The purpose is only ... ????
You have to do that policy in many ways.It's not going to stop the low fertility ...
"First of all, it is helpful!"
I think it's a habit of politicians to repeat and repeat the failed policy every time ㅡ ㅡ
"When my child is born, the house price is more than 1 billion won ... ㅠㅠ"
Employment difficulty + charter + apartment value + wedding cost + lack of parental leave + powdered milk value + charter value + prices ... I don't know how to raise my life alone.
"It's an excuse question, but I'm worried about the children, so Turbo is not the reason you mentioned above, but I don't have any children."
I agree ??
"It's just showing it. Honestly, no matter how much you think about it, there is no way to solve it"
I think it's a situation that can't be lowered even if you try to lower private education costs.

"When I was young, 20-30 years ago, my parents and grandmothers often visited the local people's house, chatting, and playing with friends in the neighborhood or village.Even though the neighborhoods were confused, I took it to my parents, and I gave it to my parents.If you call a big name from the outside, your friend's mother is eating it, so they told me to come in.Even now, even young children live in a world that is easy to solve all the media in the world with a single finger, but it is ironic that the relationship with people is more awkward and awkward."
"But from the village's point of view, I really like my child!If you meet anywhere, I smiled, smiled, and played with a face.I've often been annoyed by giving and doing it, but it's a time, but it's hard to do it."
That's right.
Pierce the essence ??
That's right. It's too hard for an individual to solve it in the family
I was a 90 -year -old who spent my childhood in the metropolitan apartment.ㅜㅜ
"When I was young, when I went to the playground, I played with the kids."
Isolation between classes deepens individualism
"Once the residential culture turned into an apartment, not a detached house, the village was disappeared.Now that the alley is now a shadow, the shadow has become a dismal alley, or you can collect insects and play in a concrete box without collecting and running in places such as rear garden or rice fields.My sister, friends, and younger brothers, I will have to take care of my younger brothers, but I'm young.The tendency to become stronger ... It would be great to be very positive for the child to learn, but on the contrary, the negative elements are prominent ...?"
"Oh, that's right"
that's right...
"Compared to economic development, cultural development is very dim so people are emotionally anomi."
You are good at talking
"@jy ._. ZZZ But isn't it true that parents have refused cooperation with society first?At school, the teacher said, “Do not discipline because we are hurt, apologize.The kid can do it.I don't care. “It's like this.“Don't say you don't want to hear, but relieve my hard work.”Is not conscientious."
@pumkinpark_Is we said yesterday?
But what I did in the village was rejected by people these days.
Isn't it genius?
That's right
"That's right.My neighborhood is 2000 generations, and I want to hear the baby crying five years ago.The aging is serious.Emergency cars come every week or twice."
"After all, the problem is accurate to see others"
"Human hate, if you live alone, you can eat and live alone.If you look at the answer .. It is not a world that sacrifices each other and lives together."
Is correct
Loss of humanity
That's right!?!?I can't refute this !!! ????????
